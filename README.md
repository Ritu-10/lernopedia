## Project Overview

1. I have used Recoil Package for State Management.
2. I have used react-router-dom for navigating.
3. I have used React Player for playing videos.

## Functionalities

1. I have used the authentication but with the help of recoil and local storage.
2. My landing page is my login page.
3. All other pages are routing protect so you have to register and login first to access the other pages.
4. I have also seperate option for Admin login and new user login.
5. Admin can add course to the site.
6. User can dynamically access the content.
7. In the courses page you will get to see all the courses.
8. You can subscribe to any course by clicking on Save For Later button.
9. The subscribed courses can be seen in the MyCourses Page.
10. In the Course and MyCourse page user can access the content of that particular course.
11. I have also added a logout option.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
